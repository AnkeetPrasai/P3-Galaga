Team 10 Project 3 Design Patterns Analysis

For project three, we had to be creative in figuring out how to code our Galaga game as this was not something we were used to.
Our team also picked up a new library in C++, SFML, that we had to get used to first. Because of the new coding abilities available,
it was very important for us to figure out design patterns that would enable us to do more and to accomplish these goals more efficiently.
We believe our project falls under a Behavioral design pattern instead of the Structural/Creational patterns as there is alot of examples
within the object scope that we used that would be considered Behavioral. For instance, we have examples of Mediator as well as other types
too like Chain of Responsibility. We did not really emphasize inheritance in our project as we had only a few classes, and they
did their own completely seperate functions. However, as explained in the definition of Mediator on Slide 22 of the Design Patterns
lecture, we defined an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. For example, our enemy class will create multiple different
enemies as there is multiple "enemy spaceships" that the player must defeat. Each enemy will also act like the other enemies, following
similar functions and member variables like if it has been destroyed or not. Just as the definition for mediator explains, our seperate
enemy objects do not refer to each other explicitly, and their interaction is independent as one "spaceship" may be destroyed, but not the
others. Other than Mediator within Behavioral, we also have instances of Chain of Responsibility as once again, our enemy class
avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request as the definition states.
This can occur during a collision of the player's shot and an enemy getting hit.
