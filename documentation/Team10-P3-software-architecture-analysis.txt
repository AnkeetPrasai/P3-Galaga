Team 10 Project 3 Software Architecture Analysis

For our third project, Galaga, there is a lot of different components that we will need
to code. It is important that we figure out how we want to organize our code and what
type of methods will be needed to progress on the project, revise it, and finally deal with
maintenance on the project if we decide to expand in the future (which we will for project 4).
After looking things over, we decided that our group would implement our project through a 
Pipes-and-Filters Architecture system in which we prioritize simplicity, maintenance and reuse,
and concurrent execution (added features can be created separately and work independently with 
other features). An example of concurrent execution in our project would be us making different
systems for allowing the player to move (up, down, left, right), shoot, and get hit. Another 
component that uses concurrent execution is the enemy which does similar actions as the player
in its own independent way (even independent from what the other enemies are doing). As shown on
slide 26 of the Software Architecture lecture, the example illustrates that a keyboard input 
(such as the up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, right arrow, etc... in our project) will call a program
(ex. move player character) followed by another (ex. updates where the AI thinks the player is positioned)
and on (ex. AI attempts to shoot back at player) and will display the output of the result. Our
full project is based on this system and is therefore using the Pipes-and-Filters Architecture system.
